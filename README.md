### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<a href="https://codecourses.site">Code Courses</a> is a website where people learn about coding and different technologies/frameworks/libraries. For the purpose of helping people learn, all of the courses are **FREE** and **DETAIL**. For this reason, Code Courses believe that you do not need to buy any courses out there. Hopefully, after following the content on Code Courses, you will find your dream jobs, and build any applications that you want.

Most of my open-source projects below are focused on one thing -  **to help people learn** ðŸ“š.

Please give me Github :star: if you feel my repositories are useful. Pull requests are highly appreciated.
